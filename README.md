## 🎯 Objective  

**MINDSTAT** explores how meditation practices influence **academic stress levels** among undergraduate students. Using quantitative and machine learning approaches, the project analyzes behavioral and emotional indicators to classify stress before and after meditation. The goal is to build predictive models that identify how meditation contributes to mental well-being and academic balance.

## 🧩 Problem Statement  

Academic stress is one of the most significant mental health concerns faced by college students. Continuous exposure to academic pressure affects focus, mental stability, and performance.  
This project investigates whether **regular meditation practices can statistically and predictively reduce stress levels**, leveraging **machine learning** for analysis and interpretation.

## 🧠 Project Workflow  

| Stage | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **1️⃣ Data Collection** | Gathered responses and stress metrics from UG students through survey-based data (pre- and post-meditation). |
| **2️⃣ Data Cleaning & EDA** | Handled missing values, normalized variables, and visualized trends in stress distribution. |
| **3️⃣ Feature Engineering** | Extracted attributes like sleep duration, study hours, concentration levels, and meditation frequency. |
| **4️⃣ Model Training** | Trained multiple ML algorithms to classify and predict stress levels. |
| **5️⃣ Model Evaluation** | Compared performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to find the most reliable model. |
| **6️⃣ Interpretation** | Interpreted model insights to understand meditation’s measurable impact on academic stress. |
